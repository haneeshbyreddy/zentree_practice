# Sending "Hello" via HTTP: A Detailed Walkthrough

## Application Layer (Layer 7)

1. The user on PC A types "Hello" into a web form and clicks "Send".
2. The web application prepares an HTTP POST request containing the message.

## Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

1. The "Hello" message is encoded into a format that can be transmitted, typically ASCII or UTF-8.
2. If encryption is used (e.g., HTTPS), the data would be encrypted at this layer.

## Session Layer (Layer 5)

1. Establishes a session between PC A and PC B if one doesn't exist.
2. Manages the dialogue control, determining whose turn it is to transmit.

## Transport Layer (Layer 4)

1. The TCP protocol adds a header to create a segment, including:
    - Source port (e.g., 49152)
    - Destination port (e.g., 80 for HTTP)
    - Sequence number
    - Other TCP flags and control information

## Network Layer (Layer 3)

1. Adds IP headers to create a packet, including:
    - Source IP address (PC A's address)
    - Destination IP address (PC B's address)
2. Determines the best route for the packet to reach PC B.

## Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

1. Adds MAC address information to create a frame:
- Source MAC address (PC A's network interface)
- Destination MAC address (next hop router or PC B if on the same network)

## Physical Layer (Layer 1)

1. Converts the frame into electrical signals, light pulses (for fiber optic), or radio waves (for Wi-Fi) and transmits them.

## Receiving Process (PC B)

1. Physical Layer: Receives the signals and converts them back into binary data.
2. Data Link Layer: Checks the frame for errors, verifies the destination MAC address.
3. Network Layer: Checks the IP address to confirm it's the intended recipient.
4. Transport Layer: Reassembles segments if needed, checks for any missing data.
5. Session Layer: Verifies this data belongs to the correct session.
6. Presentation Layer: Decrypts if necessary, converts from ASCII/UTF-8 to the application's required format.
7. Application Layer: The web server software receives the HTTP request and processes the "Hello" message.
